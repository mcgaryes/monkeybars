* Product manipulation has a wierd quirk. Should the handleProduct be called when on a group when complete? Right now it is, but in some instances it makes since not to have this be the case.
* Do I want to make the reset functionality available much like the extend method is?
* Give the ability for mixed concurrency. Meaning that a sub task can have a different concurrent boolean flag then that of its containing group.
* Chaining functionality?
* host the live docs somewhere, setup CNAME file and DNS to reroute github pages to custom URL
