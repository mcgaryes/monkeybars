{"name":"Monkeybars","body":"# MonkeyBars\r\n\r\nA task based library that provides a simple structure for handling singular, sequential and parallel units of code. \r\n\r\nThe overall architecture is based off of the [composite](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite%20pattern) and [decorator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) patterns. These patterns lend themselves very well to a task based library, where tasks can contain other tasks all contributing to the overall flow of an operation.\r\n\r\nThis library also makes it possible to run tasks [concurrrently](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing) with help of HTML5 [WebWorkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_web_workers) and [Blobs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Blob).\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nThe library itself has no ties to the browser, and because of this it works both in client side & server side javascript projects. Include *monkeybars.min.js* for your client side projects or install using [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/monkeybars) by running the following command from within your project:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$ npm install monkeybars [-g]\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nExamples for the library can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/tree/master/examples) directory of this project.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThere are detailed explanations for different aspects of the library available within the wiki pages.\r\n\r\n* [Task Implementation](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Task-Implementation)\r\n* [Extending Tasks](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Extending-Tasks)\r\n* [Decorating Tasks](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Decorating-Tasks)\r\n* [Task Options](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Task-Options)\r\n* [Concurrency](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Concurrency)\r\n\r\nFull documentation can be seen from within the [docs](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/tree/master/docs) directory of this project.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
